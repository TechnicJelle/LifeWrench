# LifeWrench
LifeWrench is a Magic: The Gathering helper app for Android
![The default layout: In the middle of the screen are three buttons: one with a 20, one with a ðŸ”ƒ and one with a 40. The screen is vertically split up into two halves. For each side there is a bar at the bottom filled with the whole spectrum of all the colours. Above that are two buttons, one with a plus and one with a minus. And finally, above that is a very big 20 that takes up most of that half of the screen. The bottom half of the screen has a red background and the top half has a green background.](default.png)

# Features
- Health counter for two player on opposite sides
- Every player can increment and decrement their own health with the `+` and `-` buttons
  - You can hold the buttons to rapidly increment or decrement health\
  ![Pretty much the same as the default layout, but the bottom half of the screen has an orange background with a big 16 on it and the top half has a pink background with a big 23 on it. The bottom half also has a smaller -8 on it.](damage-hold.png)
- Players can also change their background colour by sliding through the colour spectrum at the bottom of their side (after a few seconds the spectrum will disappear to get out of the way, but you can still change your colour at any time just by sliding again)
- In the middle are three buttons usually used for the start of the game:
  - The `20` and `40` buttons set the health of both players to that number
  - If you press the `ðŸ”ƒ` button a random player is chosen with a fun little animation\
  ![Pretty much the same as the default layout again, but the ðŸ”ƒ button in the middle of the screen has turned into a â¬†. The bottom half of the screen has a blue background with a big 26 on it and the top half has a yellow background with a big 17 on it.](player-chooser.png)
